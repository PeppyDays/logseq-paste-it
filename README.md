# logseq-plugin-paste-more
Retain formatting when pasting from external sources.

You can still use `mod+shift+t` to paste plain text.

**Update**: logseq supports `Copy & Paste with rich-text formats` since version 0.7.1.

But if you don't want to upgrade to newest version like me (due to this [issue](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/5431)), this plugin would still be useful.
